# EE551-Project: Well-log Measurements Classification using Machine Learning
# Introduction:
The oil and gas industry uses well logs to obtain a continuous record of an oil/gas well formation's rock properties and geophysical data. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. The purpose of this project is to use a classification algorithms to identify lithofacies? based on well-log measurements. 
# Data:
The data we are using for this project is from gas fields of Hugoton and Panoma gas fields provided by University of Kansas. The data set consists of over 3000 samples of well-log data with seven features from nine gas wells and rock facies classification label.
# Methodology:
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Machine Learning and Classification 
5. Analysis of Results
